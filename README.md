# To do list
We built this tool as part of the TechNova 2021 Hackathon under a 36-hour time constraint, of which we only used 15 hours, so we will be reworking the tool later.  
First orders of business :
- Re-work branding and design
- Implement database to store user profiles
- Implement matching algorithm 
- Implement additional features
